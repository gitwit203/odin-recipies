        <p>If you can make boxed macaroni and cheese, you can make this one-pan, scratch-made mac and cheese! </p>
        <p>The bacon, chives, and crispy bread crumb topping add some great extra flavor and texture.</p>
        

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni

        <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>
            
        <li> 2 cups water</li>
            
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            
        <li>¼ cup margarine</li>
            
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
            
        <li>½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            
        <li>¼ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            
        <li>¼ cup real bacon bits</li>
            
        <li>1 tablespoon snipped chives</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <p>Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally.</p>
            <p> Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>
            Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted.
            </p>
            <p>
            Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives and serve immediately. 
            </p>
